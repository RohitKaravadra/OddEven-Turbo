Single run
Goes for double
That's a good running
It's a boundary and WHAT A LITTLE BEAUTY it is
That's a wide ball and also hits a boundary
What a wonderful shot that WENT LIKE A TRACER BULLET
BANG
RUN OUT
RUN OUT
There he goes DEJECTED AS WET HEN
GOT HIM
It's miles in the air.. it's a wonderful CATCH! What a CATCH!
Dot ball
